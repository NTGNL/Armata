# Armata
Security Exploitation and Forensics Toolkit

Description
--------------
Script for automating exploitation/security analysis tasks faster. Allows the user to quickly execute commands by selecting options within the script menu. 

In order for this script to work properly you will need to edit the directory paths of some programs and set the interface names to the ones that are on your host system.

For later iterations i am planning for the script to install the required programs and dependencies itself and set the correct directory paths already for the user.

###### Disclaimer
I am not responsible for any misuse of this script, if you set someones house on fire i had nothing to do with it, i just sold you the matches.
